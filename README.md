<h1>Double Moving Average Stratergy</h1>

<p>
The DEMA uses two exponential moving averages (EMAs) to eliminate lag, as some traders view lag as a problem. The DEMA is used in a similar way to traditional moving averages (MA). The average helps confirm uptrends when the price is above the average, and helps confirm downtrends when the price is below the average. When the price crosses the average that may signal a trend change. Moving averages are also used to indicate areas of support or resistance.</p>
